### GENERAL NOTES
* 'Become a Member' should be prominent
* Homepage should not have content that requires frequent updating
* Events page has calendar view
  * + next few upcoming events listed below w/descriptions?
  * need to figure out a way to highlight the recurring events
* Blog needs new posts (Kezia volunteered)
  * general ideas: event spotlights, leadership updates, meet the team [for a particular study night]

### NEED TO CHANGE / ADD
* insert sponsor logos above footer (need list of PDX sponsors)
* nav bar:
  * ['Our Network', 'Leaders', 'Events', 'Get Involved', 'Sponsors', 'Blog', 'DONATE']
  * do we want to keep it simpler, and take out 'Leaders'?
  * what does 'Our Network' link to?
* make it clear that we host monthly networking nights, study nights, workshops, etc. (both repeat events and one-offs)
  * collapsible event list? (but this would require frequent updating)
* change the pink to a different accent color (royal blue? play w/options); and/or make teal the accent + add a third color (the yellow is fine)
* switch out the hero photo (less blues \& greens; need to look at options) + darken overlay to make text more pronounced
  * alternately, we could use a layered image of different coding languages (all code, no people)
* change 'Be a Mentor' to 'Be a Sponsor' and 'DONATE' to 'Support Us' (need to change copy as well (Morgan is putting together a copy doc)
* make social icons more prominent + add YouTube, Meetup, GitHub (assets)
  * Slack \& Twitter as well?
  * remove FB
* add Sponsor page (names, descriptions)
* increase contrast of Footer
* remove 'Jobs'

### QUESTIONS
* What are the final choices and order for the nav bar?
  * proposal: ['Get Involved', 'Events', 'Sponsors', 'Our Network', 'Blog', 'DONATE']
* Who are our PDX sponsors?
* What should 'Our Network' (in the nav bar) link to? The parent organization?
