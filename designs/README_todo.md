#### GENERAL NOTES
* Homepage should not have content that requires frequent updating
* Events page has calendar view
  * \& next few upcoming events listed below w/descriptions?
  * need to figure out a way to highlight the recurring events
* Blog needs new posts (Kezia volunteered)
  * general ideas: event spotlights, leadership updates, meet the team [for a particular study night]

#### NEED TO CHANGE / ADD
* add sponsor logos above footer (need list of PDX sponsors)
* make it clear that we host monthly networking nights, study nights, workshops, etc. (both repeat events and one-offs)
  * collapsible event list? (but this would require frequent updating)
* switch out the hero photo (less blues \& greens; need to look at options) + darken overlay to make text more pronounced
  * alternately, we could use a layered image of different coding languages (all code, no people)
* add copy under 'Be a Sponsor' and 'Support Us' (Morgan is putting together a copy doc)
* make social icons more prominent + add YouTube, Meetup, GitHub (assets)
  * Slack \& Twitter as well?
  * remove FB
* add Sponsor page (names, descriptions)

#### QUESTIONS
* What are the final choices and order for the nav bar?
  * proposal: ['Get Involved', 'Events', 'Sponsors', 'Our Network', 'Blog', 'DONATE']
* Who are our PDX sponsors?
* What should 'Our Network' (in the nav bar) link to? The parent organization?

### COMPLETED
* change the pink to a different accent color (royal blue? play w/options); and/or make teal the accent + add a third color (the yellow is fine)
* change 'Be a Mentor' to 'Be a Sponsor' and 'DONATE' to 'Support Us'
* increase contrast of Footer
* remove 'Jobs'
* changed nav bar to include: ['Get Involved', 'Events', 'Sponsors', 'Our Network', 'Blog', 'DONATE'] -- not final; needs approval
* insert SPONSOR section above footer
* 'Become a Member' should be prominent (added on top of hero image)
